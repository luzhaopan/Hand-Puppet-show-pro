        Bu Bu Dai Opera (Minnan pronunciation: boo dei hi), also known as Bu Dai
        Puppet Theatre, Hand-operated Puppet Theatre, Handbag Puppet Theatre,
        Palm Theatre, Small Cage, and Finger Blossom Theatre, is one of the most
        commonly seen Han Chinese folk theatre performances originating in
        Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China, in the 17th century. It is one of the
        traditional local theatre of the Southern Fujian language . The head of
        the puppet is carved from wood into a hollow human head, in addition to
        the puppet head, puppet palms and puppet feet, the body of the puppet
        body of the body of the puppet and the limbs of the puppet are made of
        fabric clothing; performance, the glove into the puppet's costume for
        the puppet manipulation performance. It is precisely because the body of
        the puppets in this type of performance in the early days was very much
        like a "bag made of fabric" that the common name of Bu Bu Dai Theatre
        came into being.

      <div class="title">Origin/History</div>
      <div class="text">
        Generally speaking, scholars agree that the origin of Bu Bu Dai Opera is
        Quanzhou, Fujian Province, around the 17th century. Since then, it has
        been difficult to distinguish between the different genres of Bu Bu Dai
        Opera because of the fact that the development area straddles Fujian and
        Taiwan, as well as the different periods of development and exchanges
        and fusions between the two genres. In terms of performance styles, the
        most general classification is between traditional and modern Bu Bu Dai
        Opera. Under this classification, even in Taiwan, where Bu Bu Dai Opera
        is still very popular, the audience for traditional Bu Dai Opera is much
        lower than that for modern Bu Dai Opera. What is commonly referred to as
        the Bu Bu Dai Opera genre is often actually the genre of traditional Bu
        Dai Opera.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Similar art with the bag opera, in the north and south of China called
        different, in Beijing called "Gou Li Zi", in the Northeast called "Bian
        Tan Theatre", in Sichuan called "wooden brain shell theatre", in Xi'an,
        Lanzhou is called "Juggling Rods", in eastern Fujian is called "Mantle
        Theatre", in Ningbo is called "Glove Puppet", in southern Fujian and
        Cangnan, Chongming Island, Southeast Asia and other areas of the
        southern Fujian dialect are called "布袋戲".
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The origin of Bu Bu Dai Opera can not be clearly proved. Jin Dynasty
        Wang Jia "Gleanings" records: "South of the South, there are Fu Lou
        country, its people are good at changing ...... or in the palm of the
        preparation of the music of the beasts, twisting and bending between the
        fingers. The human figure or long minutes, or several inches, the gods
        and monsters swiftly, Xuanli at the time." Female scholars Ding Yanzhao
        in the famous Dunhuang Mogao Caves Cave 31 found a painting in the Sheng
        Tang dynasty mural "to get children," painted a woman raised her arms,
        using the fingers and palms of the children to give a performance of the
        situation. Wang Jia about the skills of the finger palm of the account
        and the Tang mural depicts the situation, and today's bag opera has
        similarities, if the same form, then, bag opera or can say the emergence
        of bag puppets should be in the Tang or Jin before, but did not find a
        more explicit record, or difficult as a conclusive proof of the origin
        of the bag opera in the Tang Dynasty.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The origin of Cangnan's single-file Bubu Opera is said to have come from
        the north and the south, but from the aspect of its title, the style of
        performance which mainly focuses on literature, the use of the Southern
        Min dialect to say white, and the performances in the Southern Min
        dialect area, it should be originated from the southern school of
        Southern Min Bubu Opera, namely the Anxi school, which is rumoured to be
        introduced with the Fujian immigrants in the middle and the late Qing
        Dynasty, and according to the introduction of the entertainer Li Bulian,
        the person from Wufeng Township of Cangnan, Luhong, is the earliest of
        the main school of Cangnan's single-file Bubu Opera, the Wufeng school,
        who learnt the art from Quanzhou, Fujian. According to Li Bulian, Lu
        Hong, a native of Wufeng Township, Cangnan, was the earliest artist of
        the Wufeng School, one of the major schools of Cangnan's single-file
        布袋 theatre, who learnt his art from Quanzhou, Fujian.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        However, due to the long history, people and things are not the same, Bu
        Bu Dai Opera in Southern Fujian has evolved into a multi-file form,
        Southern Fujian can not be found in the old single-file Bu Dai Opera,
        the single-file Bu Dai Opera in Cangnan can be preserved in the source
        can only be traced back to the Qing Daoguang period. After the census,
        from the Daoguang period to the present, in Cangnan can still identify
        more than 50 famous Bu Bu Dai Opera artists. These artists are mainly
        divided into two schools, the Lingxi School and the Wufeng School, each
        of which has its own performance characteristics.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        In the Qing Dynasty, Li Dou's "Records of Yangzhou Painted Boat"
        recorded that "...... transported three-inch puppets with five fingers,
        the golden drums were noisy and angry, and the words were called
        Pelvette, and all of them were one person, which was called
        shoulder-carrying theatre." The "shoulder-loaded theatre" recorded in
        "Yangzhou Painted Boat Record" is relatively the same as the puppet
        theatre in the form of performance. Qing Jiaqing years the publication
        of the "Jinjiang County Records" Volume 72, "Customs - Songs": "There
        are Xi Dongjiao, Pipa, and the section to beat the person, cover the
        sound of heaven and earth, the former people do not think that the music
        manipulation of the soil sound, but that the Imperial Qing guest, the
        common people of today's stringed tune is also passed on. Another
        example is the seven children class, commonly known as the earth class,
        wooden theatre commonly known as puppets. Nearly again, there is a palm
        in the trick, commonly known as the bag theatre. Singing a song, each
        into a syllable." This is the earliest record of the title "布袋戏".
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The history of Bu Bu Dai Opera is quite old, as recorded in the ancient
        Chinese books "Old Story of Wulin" and "Tokyo Meng Hua Lu", palm
        puppetry was included in the gift list of the court banquet of the Song
        Dynasty. However, in the case of the traditional Bubu Opera, which is
        familiar today, the origins of the genre, in general, come from a legend
        in Quanzhou.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Legend has it that during the Ming Dynasty in China, an old man, Liang
        Binglin, who had failed all his exams, had a dream after praying for
        high school at a temple at Jiu Li Lake in Xianyou County, Fujian
        Province, in which an old man wrote on his hand, "Fame goes to the palm
        of your hand," and then left. Liang Xiucai woke up very happy, think it
        is a good omen and the first, but unexpectedly when the test and failed.
        Lost, he began to learn from his neighbours hanging silk puppetry, and
        developed a direct set in the hands of the dolls, with his literary
        training, the words, and can quote a variety of barnyard history,
        immediately attracted many people to see his performances, the bag opera
        from the local began to popular, Liang Xiucai's reputation has followed
        the rise of the boat, and at this time, he understood the meaning of the
        phrase "fame returns to the palm of your hand! It was only then that he
        realised the meaning of the saying "Fame returns to the palm of your
        hand".
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        In addition, there is another theory about the origin of Bu Bu Dai
        Opera, that it was created by Sun Qiaoren, a failed scholar from Longxi
        County, Fujian Province, during the reign of Emperor Mu Zong Longqing
        (1567-1572) of the Ming Dynasty.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Extension of Bu Bu Bu Opera: In the middle of the 17th century, Bu Bu Bu
        Opera had become quite popular in Southern Fujian, and a model similar
        to the Shoulder-Tan Opera had appeared. The so-called Shoulder-Tan
        Theatre is a theatre where the performer carries the theatre box and the
        stage on his shoulder. After arriving at a certain place and setting up
        a simple stage, the performer hides under a cloth curtain and shoulders
        the simple wooden stage, which becomes the stage for the puppet
        performance.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        In the 18th century, depending on the place of performance, not only
        professional groups appeared, but also depending on the place of
        performance, it was divided into outdoor performance of wild stage and
        theatre performance of inner stage. The Nodai Opera was performed by
        theatre troupes that were invited to perform in various places, and
        later it was gradually transformed into a performance for the purpose of
        welcoming and thanking the gods and wishing for longevity, with simpler
        sets and fewer performers.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Although the Neitai theatre style appeared in the 18th century, it
        really flourished after the 20th century. Naitai theatre has more ornate
        sets, more puppets and more musical performers than Naitai theatre.
        However, due to the impact of new forms of entertainment such as film
        and television, after the 1980s, with the exception of a few exceptions,
        Nei Tai Opera has become quite rare in Southern Fujian and Taiwan.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        On the other hand, after the 1960s, the Nei Tai Theatre also developed a
        branch of the TV play. This type of theatre, where the stage is set up
        in a TV studio and the performance is held in the studio, not only
        flourished in Taiwan after the war, but also created a sensation. The
        medium and venues of performance even extended to cable television,
        video tapes, films, compact discs and multimedia after the 1990s.
      </div>
      <div class="title">Artistic features</div>
      <div class="text">
        Bu Bu Dai Opera is characterised by the direct manipulation of the
        actors with their fingers, resulting in fast-paced, swift and powerful
        movements. Longxi Budai Opera is known for its martial arts
        performances. The head of the puppet is the main part of its structure,
        and the sculptors Xu Niansong and Xu Zhuchu, father and son, made
        outstanding contributions. They carefully researched the faces of the
        various trades and roles in the theatre, and combined their own
        experience with their artistic skills to carve and paint many puppet
        heads that profoundly reflect the typical character of good, evil,
        loyalty and treachery, in a variety of ways.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Fingers and palms are the key to the art of performance. Actors use the
        different postures of the dolls, head posture, hand posture, and step
        posture to shape the image of the dolls with inner activities, which is
        generalised, exaggerated and real, and the manipulation skills of
        "reverse set" (to show that the dolls "carry their hands") and "flying
        set" (the dolls fly out of the air or leap into the air or leap over the
        wall, and then into the other hand) are even more astonishing. The actor
        has three "selves" - the actor, the role, and the puppet, and often
        plays two or more roles with both hands at the same time, multi-tasking
        and echoing freely, which is a clear indication of the difficulty and
        the actor's skill.
      </div>
      <div class="title">Item on a program</div>
      <div class="text">
        At the beginning of its popularity in the middle of the 17th century,
        the traditional form of Bu Bu Dai Opera was quite simple, with
        improvisation being the main form of performance, and it is still
        prevalent in some parts of Fujian, for example, in Taiwan you can still
        see occasional performances of Pendulum Immortals jumping to the Eight
        Immortals and other performances that do not have a spoken word to
        welcome the gods.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        In the 18th century, the Bu Bu Dai Opera began to pay more attention to
        its performances, and there appeared plays with a performance time of
        more than one hour, such as "The Four Golden Skirts", "The Tale of the
        Robe", "The Pleasant Sparrow Sues", and so on, which are still in
        circulation today. However, the popularity of the literary theatre,
        which is based on the "Talent and Beauty" and the "Trial", is not as
        good as the martial arts theatre in the traditional Bu Bu Dai Opera
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        So far, the traditional Bu Bu Dai Opera is still dominated by martial
        arts and historical novels, with the one-hour performances of Romance of
        the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, and Feng Shen Bang (The Goddess
        of the Seals) being the most popular rewritten chapter-and-chapter
        novels.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        In general, except for the music, almost all of the plays performed by
        Bubao Opera are based on spoken dialogues, and there is no singing,
        which is quite different from other traditional Chinese dramas.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        In addition to the above, after the 1980s, in Taiwan, where the
        development of Bu Bu Dai Opera is unique, martial arts, funny science
        fiction and other plays have been developed. The performance time is
        still about one hour, and the plays no longer follow the ancient system,
        but they are not usually classified as traditional Bu Bujiao, and in
        fact, some Taiwanese audiences do not even consider their performances
        as Bujiao.
      </div>
      <div class="title">Classification of roles</div>
      <div class="text">
        Guan Gong belongs to the flower face in Bu Bu Dai Opera, although the
        classification of Bu Dai Opera roles is derived from the Chinese
        theatre's Sheng, Dan, Pure, End, and Clown, but due to the design of the
        traditional play, there are no two types of roles: the end role and the
        clown role, so Bu Dai Opera roles are divided into six major categories,
        namely the "Sheng", the "Flower Face", "Dan", "Shinto", "Monster" and
        "Miscellaneous".
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Sheng (生): refers to characters with a masculine style, of which
        Xiaosheng (小生) is usually the so-called protagonist nowadays, Wensheng
        (文生) is the intelligent male character, and Wusheng (武生) is the male
        character with an action-oriented style.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Flower Face: mainly refers to the heroic, courageous male characters
        with very strong masculinity and virility. Such as red flower, green
        flower boy, black flower and so on, in addition to its special
        protagonist category of Guan Gong and Xu Liang puppets and so on;
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Dan role: refers to the female characters with feminine temperament.
        Such as flower face Dan, Guanyin Dan, old Dan, small Dan and so on.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Shinto: such as the God of Wealth, the three immortals, in addition to
        its special protagonist category of the Dragon King of the East China
        Sea, Wen Taishi and other gods and Taoist priests and so on.
      </div>
      <div class="text">Monster: such as ox head and horse face.</div>
      <div class="text">
        Miscellaneous roles: refers to the characters who run the show. Such as
        the old monk, the little shaman, and the lack of mouth;
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Until the 20th century, the new generation of Bu Bu Dai Opera, in fact,
        there are still traces of traditional categorisation in the spoken word.
        Take the roles of Taiwan's puppet theatre as an example, Shiyanwen and
        Su Huanzhen are literati, the Chaotic Mad Knife is a martial artist,
        Hengqianqiu and Exorcist are flower faces, Ji Xiaotang is more special
        and is a martial artist, which is a newly created type of role, and
        there are also clowns, such as Qin Fake Fairy and Ertiao, which are
        beyond the traditional roles.
